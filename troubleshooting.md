# Troubleshooting Log – ESXi 7 Homelab

This document records major issues encountered during the ESXi deployment process and how they were resolved.

## Unable to Wipe Datastore (Device Busy)

### Issue
Originally tried to use usb as boot device and SSD as storage for temp storage solution. SSD already contained install of ESXi and I planned to wipe it inside ESXi. Attempting to wipe SSD via ESXi failed with “device busy” errors.

### Root Cause
ESXi system partitions were mounted and in use.

### Resolution
- Confirmed active boot disk
- Unmounted mounted filesystems
- Ultimately wiped disk externally using Windows DiskPart

### Lesson Learned
- It's easier to wipe drive with duplicated OS externally rather than innteranlly via same OS

## ESXi Web UI – Connection Refused After Moving Behind Switch

### Issue
After moving the ESXi host from a direct router connection to an unmanaged switch, the Web UI became inaccessible.

Symptoms:
- Ping to ESXi IP worked
- rhttpproxy service was running
- ESXi firewall disabled
- Browser error: ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- vmk0 showed Enabled: true with correct static IP and gateway

Despite Layer 3 connectivity working (ping), HTTPS (port 443) connections were being refused.

---

### Root Cause
After the physical network topology changed (router -> switch -> router), the ESXi management network stack did not fully rebind to the new path.

Likely contributing factors:
- Stale ARP entries on router
- MAC address table refresh delay
- Management services not properly binding after static IP was previously configured

The management interface appeared healthy but was not properly accepting TCP 443 connections.

---

### Resolution
1. Changed management network from Static -> DHCP
2. Confirmed Web UI was accessible via new DHCP IP
3. Reconfigured management network back to Static
4. Web UI began functioning normally

Switching to DHCP forced:
- Full network stack refresh
- ARP table renewal
- Proper service binding to vmk0

---

### Lesson Learned
If ESXi Web UI:
- Responds to ping
- rhttpproxy is running
- Firewall is not blocking
- But browser shows “connection refused”

Try restarting the management network or temporarily switching to DHCP to force a clean network rebind after physical network changes.

## DHCP Conflict Risk Identified

During DHCP configuration on the Windows Server, it was identified that the lab environment was operating within the same subnet as the home router.

This introduced the risk of dual DHCP servers operating within the same broadcast domain, which can lead to unpredictable IP assignment behavior.

### Resolution

The network architecture was redesigned to use a dedicated vSwitch with no physical uplink, creating a fully isolated internal lab network.

This eliminated any possibility of DHCP conflicts with the home router and provided a controlled testing environment.
