# ESXi 7 Homelab

Enterprise-style VMware ESXi 7 homelab built on physical hardware for hands-on virtualization, infrastructure, and systems administration practice.

This lab is designed to simulate a small business environment using real-world infrastructure components including Active Directory, file services, DHCP, Exchange, Windows clients, and Linux servers.

---

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

- Deploy VMware ESXi 7 on bare metal
- Design and manage VM storage architecture
- Build a multi-server Active Directory environment
- Configure core infrastructure services (DNS, DHCP, File Server)
- Deploy and manage Windows and Linux virtual machines
- Practice enterprise-style resource allocation and capacity planning
- Prepare for real-world systems administration and virtualization roles

## 🧭 Project Phasing Model

This homelab is organized and documented in structured build phases.

Each phase represents a defined milestone in the infrastructure deployment process.  
Phases build on one another and simulate how real-world infrastructure projects are executed incrementally.

The repository will be progressively reorganized into clear phase-based documentation:

- Phase 1 – ESXi Installation & Core VM Deployment
- Phase 2 – Network Design & Core Services (AD, DNS, DHCP, File Services)
- Phase 3 -

Each phase will contain:
- Goals and objectives
- Infrastructure design decisions
- Step-by-step implementation notes
- Concept explanations
- Validation testing
- Issues encountered and resolutions

> Direct links to each phase document will be added here as phases are finalized.
